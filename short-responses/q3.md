# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files delivered to the client exactly as they are stored on the server without any modifications. These assets include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, videos, fonts, and documents. In the context of React projects, the project needs to be "built" to generate these static assets, which involves converting .jsx files into .js files.
