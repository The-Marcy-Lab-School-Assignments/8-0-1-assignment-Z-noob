# Question

What does the `__dirname` environment variable return? 

# Answer
The relative path of the parent directory of the script's location. To get absolute path it's `(__dirname, '..')`.
# Teacher Feedback

Not quite, __dirname will give you the absolute path to the current directory and then from there you can add the relative path to the dist folder in the frontend!
