# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware in Express is a function that intercepts and processes incoming HTTP requests, allowing you to perform actions like parsing requests, modifying responses, or executing logic before passing control to the next middleware. In contrast, a controller is a callback function specifically designed to handle requests and send responses for a particular endpoint. Additionally, middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling, while controllers typically focus on business logic and responding to client requests.
